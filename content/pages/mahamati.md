### The Mahamati: The Great Perfection

#### Edited notes of a Western interpretation of a whispered rDzogs chen teaching.
 

One should never think of oneself as sinful or worthless but as naturally pure and lacking nothing.

There should be no feeling of striving to reach some exalted goal or higher state, since this produces something conditioned and artificial, that will act as an obstruction to the free flow of the mind.

Everything is symbolic - and yet there is no difference between the symbol and the truth symbolised.

The everyday practice is simply to develop a complete acceptance and openness to all situations and emotions and to all people, experiencing everything totally without mental reservations or blockages so that one never withdraws or gets stuck onto oneself.

This produces a tremendous energy, which is usually locked up in a process of mental evasion and generally running away from life experiences.

Clarity of awareness in its initial stages may be unpleasant or fear inspiring; if so then one should open oneself completely to the pain or fear and welcome it.

In this way the barriers created by ones own emotional reactions and prejudices are broken down.

Since all things are naked, clear and free from obscurity, there is nothing to attain or realise. The nature of things naturally appears and is always present.

Learn to see everyday life as a mandala in which one is the centre and free from bias and prejudice of past conditioning, present desires and future hopes.

Therefore be natural, spontaneous, accept and learn from everything. See the ironical and amusing side of irritating situations. The figures of the mandala are the day to day objects of one's own life experience.

One should realise that one does not meditate in order to go deeply into oneself and withdraw from the world. One should think of it just as a natural function of everyday life like eating or breathing, not as a special, formal event to be undertaken with great seriousness or solemnity.

Just plunge straight into meditation at this very moment with one's whole mind, and be free of hesitation, boredom or excitement.
