### Booking
Booking is not necessary, you just turn up.


### Money
It's always free for the first visit.  After that we ask for £2 towards the hire of the hall.


### Clothes
If you want to do the lotus posture, yoga style on a cushion on the floor, then please wear loose clothes.  Otherwise if you want to sit in a chair then it doesn't really matter.  Wear whatever you are comfortable in.


### Previous Experience
We are very happy to help people begin practice from scratch. The group is also a good resource for those who are already practictioners.


### Being a Buddhist
You don't have to be a Buddhist to attend this group.  We regard this as essentially a personal matter. The group is in the Mahayana Buddhist Chan tradition and we expect attendees to respect this tradition.
