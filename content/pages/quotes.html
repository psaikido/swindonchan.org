<div class="randomQuote">
	We may dig in our heels and dare life never to change, but, all the same, it changes under our feet like sand under the feet of a sea gazer as the tide runs out. Life is forever undermining us. Life is forever washing away our castles, reminding us that they were, after all, only sand and sea water.

<div class="randomQuote">
	Do not pursue the past.<br>
    Do not lose yourself in the future.<br>
    The past no longer is.<br>
    The future has not yet come.<br>
    Looking deeply at life as it is<br>
    in the very here and now,<br>
    the practitioner dwells<br>
    in stability and freedom.<br>
    We must be diligent today.<br>
    To wait until tomorrow is too late.<br>
    Death comes unexpectedly.<br>
    How can we bargain with it?<br>
    The sage calls a person who knows<br>
    how to dwell in mindfulness<br>
    night and day<br>
    'one who knows<br>
    the better way to live alone.'<br>
    <br>
    Bhaddekaratta Sutta
