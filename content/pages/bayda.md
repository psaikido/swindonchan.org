### Ezra Bayda - What is Our Life About?

Our aspiration, our calling, our desire for a genuine life,  
is to see the truth of who we really are -  
that the nature of our Being is connectedness and love,  
not the illusion of a separate self to which our suffering clings.  
It is from this awareness that Life can flow through us;  
the Unconditioned manifesting freely as our conditioned body.
 

And what is the path?  
To learn to reside in whatever life presents.  
To learn to attend to all those things  
that block the flow of a more open life;  
and to see them as the very path to awakening -  
all the constructs, the identities,  
the holding back, the protections,  
all the fears, the self-judgements, the blame -  
all that separates us from letting life be.
 

And what is the path?  
To turn away from constantly seeking comfort  
and from trying to avoid pain.  
To open to the willingness to just be,  
in this very moment,  
exactly as it is.
