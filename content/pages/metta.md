### Metta Bhavana - Loving Kindness

Find a quiet place where you will be undisturbed for 20/30 minutes or so. Gently close your eyes and take a few deep breaths. Relax. Really let your body let go of it's tensions. Allow yourself to release whatever issues you may be thinking about.

Imagine out in front of you, a point of light. It is a beautiful golden light. Warm and calming, it radiates out a healing light, so lovely, kind and gentle. It starts to come towards you, as it comes close you can see that it's about the size of an apple. You can feel it's warmth. It comes and floats right over the top of your head, just a few inches above the very top of your head, shining it's beautiful light onto you. You relax further and the light gently sinks down and enters your head. Feel the golden light pouring into your head, filling up the inside, penetrating through all the inside of your head. Silently say to yourself:

May I be well.

May I be happy.

May I be free from suffering.

the light grows stronger and flows down your neck, healing and warming everything it touches, spreading through your shoulders, down your arms, down your back and through your chest. Shining strongly now throughout your stomach, lower back, your whole abdomen

May I be well.

May I be happy.

My I be free from suffering.

the golden light is bathing the upper half of your body and now it's flowing down through your pelvis, thighs, down through your knees and shins, calves, ankles, feet, right to the tips of your toes. The light suffuses every cell in your whole body, helping any part that needs healing, rest and kindness. Just sit there and let the light bathe you, there's no need to do anything.

Gradually the light starts to shine so brightly that it glows through your skin. Your body begins to radiate this beautiful golden light and illuminate the air around you, growing into a large space around you. Just as you want to be well and happy

May others be well.

May others be happy.

May others be free from suffering.

 

letting the light glow very brightly, reaching far away, through the towns and fields, reaching past the horizons, all the way around the world

May we all be well.

May we all be happy.

May we all be free from suffering.

imagine now the whole great earth shining this fantastic light out through space, far brighter than the sun, to the ends of the universe, to the ends of time

May all that lives be well.

May all that lives be happy.

May all that lives be free from suffering.

take your time, and when you're ready, bring the light back into yourself, flowing back to you along the lines that you sent it out. Returning to the earth, back over the horizons, back to the space around you, back to your body, gathering at a point in the center of your chest. Eventually all the golden light contains itself in a tiny seed at the centre point of your chest, your heart centre. It will be there whenever you may need it again. Always ready to respond with love and kindness in whatever way is appropriate.
