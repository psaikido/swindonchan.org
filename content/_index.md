<div class="randomQuote">

Do not pursue the past.<br>
Do not lose yourself in the future.<br>
The past no longer is.<br>
The future has not yet come.<br>
Looking deeply at life as it is<br>
in the very here and now,<br>
the practitioner dwells<br>
in stability and freedom.<br>
We must be diligent today.<br>
To wait until tomorrow is too late.<br>
Death comes unexpectedly.<br>
How can we bargain with it?<br>
The sage calls a person who knows<br>
how to dwell in mindfulness<br>
night and day<br>
'one who knows<br>
the better way to live alone.'<br>
<br>
Bhaddekaratta Sutta
